# LedgerLoops

Examples:

* in-browser: shows a graph of friends, you can tell friends to give each other money, and they will cooperate to find and resolve ledger loops.
* client-server: example where Marsellus lives server-side, while Mia and Vincent live client-side. Shows and tests how WebSockets are used.
* monetized-blog: static page, combined with a WebSocket server, that will accrue money when a user with the LedgerLoops browser extension visits this page.
